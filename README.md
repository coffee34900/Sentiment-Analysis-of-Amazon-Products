# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Amazon-Products
Models used : Gaussian, Logistic and Neural Network

A high number of products are purchased every day by customers thus there are millions of product reviews. Sentiment analysis is the process of detecting positive or negative attitudes in a text. Sentiment analysis has become a crucial area for businesses. It helps businesses understand how customers feel about the product or the service. Analysis of customer reviews on Amazon enables businesses to fix or improve their product by reviewing the results of the analysis. As businesses see the data, their decisions on the product become more accurate. The sentiment analysis on products listed on amazon.com by various businesses should be done so that businesses can have a scientific foundation on how to change their product or service as well as how customers feel about their products or services. 

In this project, our aim is to automate the process of classification of product reviews. We will be using a data set that contains approximately  586000 product reviews for different products from amazon.com. This project is significant for businesses because it creates a scientific base for their customer feedback.
